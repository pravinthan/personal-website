## About

> I am currently seeking new opportunities and new challenges to improve myself

I've had a passion for designing and developing software since my early high school days. From my very first Turing "Hello, world!" program to this website, I have grown my skills for over 8 years and am ready to take on bigger challenges. As always, I am continuing to learn new and upcoming technologies relevant to developers. Some of my interests include playing and watching basketball (**We the North!**) and building computers.
